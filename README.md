while voat/voat (https://github.com/voat/voat) is dead (unmaintained for over two years) i've decided to pick-up the code and make it work for my pet-project.

# Quick Status Updates

This branch is fully building on .NET Core 2 Preview and a majority of unit tests and UI are ported and working.

Right now we are concentrating on getting 100% unit test coverage. 

# Voat Branch for .NET Core Port (With the PostgreSQL Branch Merged)

Currently using .NET Core 2 Preview and Visual Studio 2017 Preview
